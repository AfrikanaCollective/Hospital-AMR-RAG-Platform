"""Narrative generation (ARCH §15.1 steps 2-6; PRD-060, PRD-061, PRD-064).

- extract a field subset actually present in the (possibly sparsened) record
  (step 3),
- generate a scope-1-framed narrative via `LLMGateway` (`MODEL_ID`), low
  temperature, fixed template (step 4),
- validate grounding of the narrative (`app.eval.question_gen.validate`,
  step 5) and reject-and-retry up to `QGEN_MAX_RETRIES`,
- return a dict shaped for an `eval_question` row (step 6 — persistence
  itself is a follow-on, not done here).

Picking the source record (step 2: matching a guideline's applicability,
sparsening for `missing_info_expected`, choosing a corpus-gap scenario for
`no_guideline_expected`) and the diversity filter / gold re-check (steps 7-8,
which need a populated corpus to check against) are **not** implemented here
— see DEVIATIONS.md #67. This module implements steps 3-6 for an
already-chosen `source_record`.

**Scope-1 framing is enforced twice** (DEVIATIONS.md #66): once in the
prompt template itself, and independently in `_is_scope1_framed` after
generation — a model can drift from instructions, and this question set
becomes the actual query input to the RAG system, so a scope violation here
would mean the eval harness itself manufactures out-of-scope queries. Never
"what should be done" / "what treatment" / "next step for this patient" —
only "what does the guideline recommend for a patient/infant presenting with
X" (ARCH §15.1 step 4's own mandated wording).

ONLY acceptable shape is: "What does the guideline recommend for a(n) \
<newborn/infant/patient> presenting with <findings>?" (light rephrasing of \
this exact shape is fine; asking for anything else is not).
- NEVER ask what should be done, what treatment to give, what the next step \
is, what medication or dose to use, or anything else that asks the reader to \
decide or act for this specific patient. This is a guideline LOOKUP question, \
not a request for a clinical decision.
- Mention ONLY clinical findings, history, vitals, and demographics that are \
explicitly listed below. Do not invent, assume, or infer any finding, \
timeline, or history not listed. Do not state that a finding is absent \
unless it is explicitly listed as absent/negative.
- Use only information that would be available at admission.

explanation, just the question."""

# a clinical impression not present in the record (e.g. medications
# "gentamicin"/"penicillin" -> the word "sepsis", a diagnosis label no

it is typically used to treat. Rewrite the question using only the exact
