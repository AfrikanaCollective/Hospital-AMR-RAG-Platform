"""Multi-rater workflow state machine (ARCH §14.2, §14.3; PRD-042, PRD-043, PRD-047).

UNRATED -> OPEN_QUEUE -> (>= IRR_MIN_RATERS distinct raters) -> compute IRR -> ARCHIVED.
Until the minimum is met the result stays visible in the open queue to any
clinician (except its producer / raters who already rated it).

Distinctness is enforced twice: `is_eligible_rater` here (checked before
insert, so a duplicate submission gets a clear application error) AND the DB's
own `UNIQUE (result_id, rater_id)` constraint on `rating_round` (ARCH §14.2,
the actual backstop). "All domains scored" is enforced upstream by
`app.schemas.rubric.RatingRoundRequest` (exactly 11 scores, one per domain,
required on every submission) — so every successfully-inserted round already
satisfies it by construction; `can_archive`'s `all_domains_scored_by_each` is
always `True` here.

`result_producer_id` (the "did not produce the result" half of
`is_eligible_rater`) is always `None` in this pipeline: every rated result is
system-produced (an agent-generated answer or a question-generator output),
never authored by a clinician, so there is no producer to exclude.

**Queue visibility + priority (`select_queue_items`, DEVIATIONS.md #113):**
ARCH §14.2 documents only the `< 3` visibility cutoff, not an ordering
between an unrated result and a partially-rated one. Reviewer-stated rule:
the queue only ever shows results with 0-2 distinct rating rounds from other
clinicians; if ANY of those has 1-2 rounds already, ONLY those are offered
(finishing an in-progress result toward the 3-rater minimum takes priority
over starting a fresh one) — once none remain, the 0-round results become
selectable. `list_queue_candidates` does the DB read (open, excluding
whatever the caller has already rated); `select_queue_items` is the pure
priority rule over that list, unit-tested without a database, same style as
`is_eligible_rater`/`can_archive` above.
