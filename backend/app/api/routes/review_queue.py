"""Open review queue (PRD-042, PRD-047; ARCH §14.2).

GET  /review-queue                 (reviewer) -> results this reviewer may currently pick to
                                                 rate. Visibility + priority rule
                                                 (DEVIATIONS.md #113): only 0-2-round `open`
                                                 results, excluding anything this reviewer
                                                 already rated; if ANY of those has 1-2 rounds
                                                 ("in progress"), ONLY those are returned —
                                                 finishing an in-progress result takes priority
                                                 over starting a fresh (0-round) one, which only
                                                 becomes selectable once no in-progress result
                                                 remains (`app.rubric.workflow.select_queue_items`,
                                                 the actual rule; `list_queue_candidates`, the
                                                 DB read).
GET  /review-queue/{result_id}     (reviewer) -> result + citations for rating (no other raters'
                                                 scores)
Hard/adversarial cases are in the SAME queue (PRD-047).

**`eval.result` row creation** (DEVIATIONS.md #79, #113): this router only
reads existing `Result` rows. `app.eval.auto_seed` is the first writer
(auto-generated, de-identified-record-sourced hypotheticals, run through the
real query pipeline and queued `open` immediately); a live `/query` result
or a clinician-submitted one may write here too in the future, under the
same `Result.answer_enc` AAD contract (`app.db.models.eval.result_answer_aad`).
